REQUIREMENTS

  Kernel headers needed to build virtualbox's modules.


PRE-INSTALL


POST-INSTALL

  Run the post-install script in order to add a vboxusers group to your system.
  After that, add your user to the vboxusers group:
  # usermod -a -G vboxusers <your_user> 
  
  During installation 'vboxdrv.ko' has been installed to your modules directory
  and you can load it using modprobe vboxdrv (needed before run VirtualBox).
  Also make sure you give yourself read and write access to /dev/vboxdrv.
  For this, virtualbox port has their own udev rules.

  Also is a good idea to fine tune your udev rules as you want.
  For getting some info from your system run udevinfo:
  # udevinfo -a -p /sys/class/misc/vboxdrv

  Udevinfo starts with the device specified by the devpath and then
  walks up the chain of parent devices. It prints for every device
  found, all possible attributes in the udev rules key format.
  A rule to match, can be composed by the attributes of the device
  and the attributes from one single parent device.

    looking at device '/class/misc/vboxdrv':
    KERNEL=="vboxdrv"
    SUBSYSTEM=="misc"
    SYSFS{dev}=="10:62"


PRECAUTION

 Virtualbox by default uses /usr/src/linux as the source directory of your Linux kernel.
 To use an alternative kernel directory you should type something like:
 # env KERN_DIR=/not-default-path/src/linux pkgmk

 If you have problems trying to update virtualbox (xalan-c not found...) use
 this command to solve it:
 # prt-get update -fr xerces-c xalan-c
 and then rebuild virtualbox
