If you want to have Tomcat running on port 80 please modify the server.xml
file accordingly.

It is a Good Thing (tm) to drop down Tomcat runtime privileges.
To do so, add user named `tomcat` to your system, like this:

# groupadd tomcat
# useradd -g tomcat tomcat
# passwd -l tomcat

Then you can change the TOMCAT_USER and TOMCAT_GROUP variables in 
/etc/rc.d/tomcat from `root` to `tomcat`
